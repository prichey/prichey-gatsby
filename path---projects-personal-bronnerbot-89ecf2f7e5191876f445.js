The label, rambling, whimsical, and circuitous, almost seems as if it\nwere generated from a Markov chain rather than written by Dr. Bronner himself.\nSo, I figured, why not train a model on copy transcribed from each individual\nlabel?</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A PSALM OF SOAP EXCELLENCE</p>&mdash; bronnerbot (@bronnerbot) <a href="https://twitter.com/bronnerbot/status/883838107661078528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 9, 2017</a></blockquote>\n<p>I found several labels ready-transcribed online, but for the remaining few I\nfound an image and typed by hand. (This explains bot typos, which happen every\nso often). Each variety of soap has a slightly different label, which made for\nan 8,000+ word\n<a href="https://github.com/prichey/bronnerbot/blob/master/corpus/label.txt" target="_blank">text\nfile</a> to train the model. After generating the model, I scheduled the bot to\ntweet every 6 hours and @bronnerbot was live. It has been tweeting regularly\nsince 2015, and has tweeted over 5,000 times. The bot gained only a handful of\nfollowers (39, at time of this writing), but ultimately I made the bot for\nmyself. Most of its tweets are nonsensical riffs on \'ALL-ONE! ALL-ONE!\' (which\nis a crutch Dr. Bronner leaned on more often than any other), but occasionally\nthe bot tweets something serendipitously poetic. I\'m convinced all that\ntranscription was worth it.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Soap can make Love last 1 trillion years of sweet eternities!</p>&mdash; bronnerbot (@bronnerbot) <a href="https://twitter.com/bronnerbot/status/875774977609478144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 16, 2017</a></blockquote>',frontmatter:{title:"@bronnerbot",link:"https://twitter.com/bronnerbot",repo:"https://github.com/prichey/bronnerbot",date:"2015",zoom:null,lang:"Ruby"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/projects/personal/bronnerbot/"}}}});
