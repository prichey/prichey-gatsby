This meant we all got to know\neach other very well, and we ended up with all sorts of inside jokes and bits.\nOne of these involved a particular coworker, Fred, who had a knack for making\nthe most ridiculous, off-the-wall comments, which became known as\n<em>Fred-thoughts</em>. This became such a regular occurrence that our then-CTO started\na <a href="https://twitter.com/FromFredsMouth" target="_blank">Twitter\naccount</a> to keep a permanent record of the this coworker\'s \'best\' lines\n(anything tweeted from the account was first okay-ed by the coworker).</p>\n<p>Eventually, we set up a Slack channel devoted to documenting these thoughts.\nEvery so often an admin would go through and tweet out the best lines. This\nhappened intermittently at best, and the lines would just pile up. I had spent a\nbit of time playing around with\n<a href="https://botkit.ai/" target="_blank">Botkit</a>, so I succumbed to that\ndeveloper\'s base-instinct and sought out to automate the process.</p>\n<p>If you use Slack, you probably know that you can \'react\' to messages with a\nparticular emoji. I had the idea of using reactions to allow coworkers either to\napprove or veto Fred-thoughts. I decided to require 3 üëç reactions before the\nmessage would be tweeted, and any message receiving any üëé reactions would\nautomatically be prevented from being posted. That way, either Fred himself or\nanyone else concerned about the thought being tweeted out publicly would be able\nto veto it.</p>\n<p>The bot ran successfully for over 6 months until Fred moved on to another\njob, leaving the rest of us devoid of his precious nuggets of inspiration.\nStill, we had a permanent record of past thoughts, which was certainly\nbetter than nothing.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Amy: &quot;What kind of cat is it?&quot;<br>Fred: &quot;Normal.&quot;</p>&mdash; Fred Thoughts (@FromFredsMouth) <a href="https://twitter.com/FromFredsMouth/status/604444640335429633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2015</a></blockquote>',frontmatter:{title:"Fred-thoughts Bot",link:"",repo:"https://github.com/prichey/fredthoughts-bot",date:"2016",zoom:null,lang:"Node.js"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/projects/personal/fredthoughts-bot/"}}}});
